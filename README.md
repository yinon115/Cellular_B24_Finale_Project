# Cellular_B24_Finale_Project

Welcome to BARBERBOOK
This is an application designed to help barbers manage their appointments with their clients
Each client can register and create a user with which he can make appointments on his own without having to wait for an answer from his barber and in addition he can browse the existing haircut catalog.

Each barber will be able to manage its appointments and see all future appointments and cancel if necessary.
